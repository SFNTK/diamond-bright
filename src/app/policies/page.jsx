If you are not 100% satisfied with any part of the cleaning service, we are happy to re-clean any missed areas free of charge at TIME OF SERVICE. In an event where clients are unable or choose not to perform the walk through inspection, we assume service is completed and we will not do additional re-cleanings.

            NOTE: After walk-through is done, our services are complete. There will be additional fees charged if asked to come back for cleaning. For move-out cleanings, it is recommend to have your landlord do the inspection walkthrough with our cleaners.
